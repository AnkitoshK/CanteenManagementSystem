Using C++ language this is a simple project where we can add details of food and add details of workers/employee...means we can modify the system as according to user.
It follows the CRUD method:

+ C: CREATE
+ R: READ
+ U: UPDATE
+ D: DELETE

This project includes some facilities of customers and products search, display, modification, delete etc. This software searches the client data which is stored in the record and then gives permission to place the order by the customer.
